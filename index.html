   <p>Outside of a few small potted house plants, palms are a huge unknown to people living outside of their native habitat. 
   They have characteristics unlike anything known to people living in other areas.  They don't have any branches. They aren't 
   even woody plants.  Their bulk comes from a mass of woven fibers which were the old bases of former leaves. Trunks of dead palms 
   will yield to pressure like a straw mat. Their entire canopy consists of giant leaves either at ground level for young
   specimens or atop a stalk for older ones.  Palms remain at ground level until a base the size of the trunk is formed. 
   Upward growth is delayed until this is accomplished.</p>
   <p>There are two main types: the feather leaf and the fan leaf. The feather leaf is the most common but is not common
   outside of the tropics.  It is recognized by leaves having parallel leaflets attached to a rib which runs the entire
   length of the leaf defined as a frond.  The fan leaf is recognized by leaf segments radiating out from a common point forming a circular
   section so as to give the appearance of a fan.  By the way, the palm used on Palm Sunday is the leaf segment of <em>Sabal
   Palmetto</em> from the Southeastern coastal States.  It's a weed in Florida and I'm sure Floridians consider its use on Palm
   Sunday good riddance.</p>
   <p>Palms are named according to the standard binomial naming convention for plants and animals.  They are classified into a genus
   based on their simple flower and fruit type then further subdivided in species based on more detailed characteristics of
   the flowers and fruit.  Some species have had their classification changed as more was understood about them.</p>
   <p>In general Palms complain about the climate of California or even Florida in USDA zones 9 and 10, but to ask them to grow
   in USDA zone 6 is sheer lunacy.  A few lunatics out there have bet on the odds.</p>

   Success requires an overall knowledge of gardening in general, a knack for innovation, a minimum level of expertise in
   weather and climate and free time.  Expertise in the weather is by far the most critical, especially if one plans to
   expose palms to the weather unprotected.</p>

<p>A few species can be recommended, but only two have a prayer of surviving the rigors of a Zone 6 continental winter.
They are a Chinese species, <em>Trachycarpus fortunei</em>, known colloquially as the Windmill palm&#150;unless one has a British
 accent then Chusan palm wins&#150;and the southeast USA species, <em>Rhapidophyllum hystrix</em>, appropriately named the Needle palm.
Both are of course fan-leaved species. The American species only grows well in summer heat.  The Chinese species will perform
satisfactorily in a cool Oceanic climate.

<p>Both of these palms are a far cry from the graceful feather-leafs found only near Miami or in Hawaii.  They have hairy fibers
covering the entire length of the trunk.  The Windmill has unattractive uneven matty fur surrounding the entire trunk
which contrasts poorly with the clean trunks found in more tropical regions.  But the tropical effect it can lend to 
an unaccented disposable-leafed mid-latitude garden shouldn't be underestimated.
</p>
<p>Some accounts state that the Needle palm can survive -20 &#176;F.  My experience is that it begins to languish when the
temperature approaches 10 &#176;F.  I have read accounts that the Windmill palm has survived temperatures of -6 &#176;F at the
University of North Carolina.  I have had healthy specimens survive single digit temperatures without missing a beat.
In my opinion, this makes that account believable.  In my experience the Windmill palm withstands prolonged periods of 
freezing much better than does the Needle palm; although, I should take into account the fact that my Windmill palms
were older than the Needles were.</p>

<p>Getting the palm through the vagaries of midwinter isn't the end of the battle.  Often the biggest challenge is getting
the palm through the spring or equally in some cases the fall.  The continental US has huge temperature swings in any season
but especially in late winter or spring.  A palm that has survived much lower temperatures can easily succumb to 
a minor frost in late winter or spring after the growing season has begun.  And going back to the characteristics of
palms; since, they don't have any branches, they don't regenerate.  Once the top of palm is lost&#150;the only point from which
they grow&#150;you have to start over with another palm.  The needle palm is more forgiving in this regard; since, it suckers
freely like a wild grass.  So if you lose one, its neighboring clone may have survived. Trouble is removing the dead one
is another story; since, they are covered from head to toe in long sharp spines.  It takes patience to determine which one
of the hairy fibers surrounding it are actual fibers and which ones are the sharp spines. Any misjudgment inevitably leads
to blood loss. It's almost impossible to touch one of these without a puncture.  They're extremely sharp.  The spines need to be
removed if they are to be used as a landscape plant.
</p>
<p>For those that insist on the feather leaf no matter what, there is a species to try, <em>Butia capitata</em>, the Pindo palm.  Unliike
its tropical cousins this species can handle a few hours of freezing up to maybe a day or so.  A minimum temperature below 20 &#176;F
is shooting dice. Another drawback to this palm is its huge size.  Under ideal conditions it will have ten foot leaves at
ground level before a trunk the size of a suspension bridge pillar forms.  Growing these will mandate an elaborate greenhouse
structure to protect them in winter as opposed to simpler protection required for the recommended fan leafs.  For those willing to endure
the extra effort, they can enjoy the edible fruits this palm produces as the real palm aficionado does in St. Louis.  Ironically the 
seeds they contain can sprout up the following spring even if completely exposed to the winter only to die the following winter once the leaves have formed.
